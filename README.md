# Version 0.3
Refactored the code, there is only two global variables.
One for the utilities (polyfills)
One for the lightbox itself

TODO:
Optimize the code if possible (it is ^^)
Make it easily customizable
Add animation fadinf, sliding, etc...

# Version 0.1
Poor code, the goal is to get a lightbox effect working on IE7+, chrome and firefox.
